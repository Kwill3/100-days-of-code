# 100 Days of Code, progress log.

<h2 align="center"> Intro </h2>
Hello World! William Lee here and this is my log for the 100 Days of Code challenge. I've been learning coding on my own (online) for the most of the past year but I haven't been seriously making projects until recently. Since May 2018, I've been going through courses on codecademy and freecodecamp so I've had some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript which should be sufficient for me to start doing some simple projects. In hindsight, the most useful thing I have learnt so far is to know how to search for the answers online and where to look for them. A lot of resources are actually easily found online but otherwise it would be helpful to have a friend or find help from the community. By the end of this challenge I hope to be able to at least be proficient in all the basics of front-end scripts and know how and where to learn the advanced concepts.

**Today's Progress**: Today is all about learning how to use GitHub through the terminal in Visual Studio Code, which is the IDE that I am using currently. I posted my 'test' repository and written down the steps from cloning the repository to adding and committing and putting update descriptions.

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp's GitHub tutorial by Tiffany Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0EYpi38Yp4)

**Thoughts**: GitHub definitely comes off as being intimidatingly intricate and using terminal to commit to repositories, even much so. However I hope to be able to make heads or tails of the whole site and it's functions as I've heard it is really useful to know the capabilities of GitHub.

**Today's Progress**: Did a simple clock project that takes the time from your device. 

**Resources**: [Coder's Digital Clock Project](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/digital_clock/index.html)
[My own clock (Repository in GitHub)](https://github.com/Kwill3/clock)

**Thoughts**: It is a very simple project, very suitable for absolute beginners and in my case very refreshing to go over all the HTML and CSS scripts that I have learned a while back. It did taught me something new thought, which was how to use jQuery. It is my first time using jQuery and I hope to learn more about it.

**Intro**: Started another clock project (I have no obsessions with clocks, I promise) which I have been wanting to do for a long time but never gotten around to doing it. I first saw this clock from Destin of SmarterEveryDay, back then I haven't even started learning coding and I was gonna build the physical clock but never gotten around to it. Now I get to build the virtual one! It is called a TIX clock and it is one geeky little clock. 

**Today's Progress**: I started by searching online to see if anyone has come up with one and found Xavier Decuyper's JS TIX clock, then I read through his blog post and tried to the best of my abilities to write my own code. I admit I had to resort to reading his source code to figure out how to structure my own JS code. I wasn't able to get mine to run.

**Resources**: [Xavier Decuyper's TIX](https://www.savjee.be/2014/02/TixClock-clone-in-Javascript/)
[SmarterEveryDay](https://youtu.be/VvVigAr4hZc?t=660)

**Thoughts**: I still have a ways to go to be proficient in Javascript, I would like to be able to write my own code for the entirety of a project without having to refer to someone else's code but sometimes I just don't know what functions do I need to use. I might need to do some reading on people's codes and see if I can't learn something.

<h2 align="center">  Day 3: 21 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued with my TIX clock, still did not manage to get it running correctly. I discovered a fault in my Visual Studio Code environment, which I must have set up incorrectly. When trying to 'node <js filename here>' in my terminal, my javascript file keeps getting 'document' and 'windows' not defined error prompts. I thought it was that I wasn't using the 'onload' or 'document.ready' or putting 'defer' to my JS script but after scouring the internet for hours and even asking for help from a friend, I still did not find out what was wrong.

**Thoughts**: By the end of the day before retiring to bed, my plans for tomorrow is to find out the root cause, which I figure probably might have something to do with the 'node' not working correctly in my IDE to access the DOM. I have squinted at every line of my code and still could not find what is wrong, it doesn't help that I couldn't use the debug feature on VS either (which might be also because of the same error).

<h2 align="center"> Day 4: 22 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the TIX clock project, figured the reason for 'node' running on my JS file to have undefined properties for 'document' is because it is just running the external JS file which is not linked to the HTML file therefore would not be defined. I also learned a bit more about source control in VS Code.

**Thoughts**: Still struggling with using the full functionality of VS Code but overall improving my working knowledge of it. It is very helpful and saves me a lot of keystrokes though, just need to figure out how to debug my future external JS files or find another way to build the projects.

**Today's Progress**: Completed one of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Project, which is the Survey Form Project.

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design - Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/)
[My Survey Form - CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/JZXaqb)
[GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Survey)

**Thoughts**: This was a fairly interesting project which I built with HTML and CSS, didn't find it to be too difficult but still had to look up online to jog my memory especially on the 'forms' part. OVerall, I now feel more confident working with HTML.

<h2 align="center"> Day 6: 24 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Got started on the next Responsive Web Design project by FreeCodeCamp which is to design a Product Landing Page. This is a much more challenging project for me because I never got to work with headers and video links prior to this, which meant I had to watch a tutorial before I could start writing my code. Also, I was recommended to use Bootstrap for this and the following projects. Thus my side quest to learn Bootstrap begins...

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design - Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/)

**Thoughts**: Still learning the ropes on Bootstrap. Got into a bit of a jam, I actually had some problems trying to add the bootstrap scripts into my html but I am still determined to push on.

<h2 align="center"> Day 7: 25 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Product Landing page, managed to get the navigation bar to work. Watched a lot of tutorial videos and read Bootstrap documentation to better understand how to use Bootstrap to design my project.

**Resources**: [Bootstrap Navbar Resources](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar)

**Thoughts**: Managed to learn a lot about Bootstrap today, I think I am starting to get confident with using it. The challenge is to use Bootstrap and still fulfill all the requirements set to the project by FCC, not just create a nice looking landing page. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 8: 26 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: I just found out I have been updating my files wrongly in GitHub, I have been pushing commits into the master branch all the while. The best practice is to make a new branch, commit and push, then make a pull request to add it into the master branch. This is best practice to make the master branch 'clean'. Well I'm glad I found that out early. Besides that, I managed to complete almost 80% of the Landing Page project.

**Resources**: [GitHub commandline resources](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html)

**Thoughts**: Everything went smoothly today. Bootstrap is actually a very handy tool in helping move things around according to the screen size, I'm glad there are tools out there like this to help make designing a device compatible website easier. Its funny to think that 24 hours ago, this seemed like a daunting task but now feel so intuitive.

<h2 align="center"> Day 9: 27 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Product Landing Page project. Next project is the Technical Documentation Page, which looks quite simple. I should be able to complete this without much difficulty.

**Resources**: [Product Landing Page CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/eXOgJQ)
[FreeCodeCamp - Technical Documentation Page Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page/)

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to have completed the project, after several days of working on it. Several images won't be able to load inside CodePen because I used an external image link which I am not able to upload into CodePen because I do not have a Pro account yet. Nevertheless you can get the full files and source code from my GitHub, if you are curious (it's nothing special though).

<h2 align="center"> Day 10: 28 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Almost all the way through with the Technical Documentation Page, just need to fix the side navigation bar which is proving to be difficult so far.

**Thoughts**: Working with Bootstrap certainly makes things a lot easier but I wonder if I need to train myself to know the intricate details of CSS so that it will help me immensely when I try to design in detail.

<h2 align="center"> Day 11: 01 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Technical Documentation Page by changing side navigation styling from Bootstrap to just pure CSS. Bootstrap wasn't working correctly to attach the navigation bar to the left of the page. Getting started on the last project in the Responsive Web Design series of FCC.

**Resources**: [Technical Doc in CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/zbrpqa)
[Personal Portfolio Webpage by FCC](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to finally come close to obtaining my first certification by FCC. I want to move on to hone my Javascript Algorithm and Data Structures skills next so I will probably be doing a lot of the for the whole of next week.

<h2 align="center"> Day 12: 02 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final Responsive Web Project by FCC!

**Resources**: [Personal Portfolio CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/rReOMe)
[Personal Portfolio GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Personal-Portfolio)

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking of getting an image web hosting service, as I have only been using external attachments for images so far. For websites like CodePen, I am not able to link to my images to my projects and thus the page looks quite barren. Besides that, I am very proud to have completed the Responsive Web Design Projects by FCC and gotten my first certification. I will be aiming for the other achievements moving forward.

<h2 align="center"> Day 13: 03 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started on FreeCodeCamp's Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Resources**: [FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)

**Thoughts**: I've always had trouble with Javascript algorithms, it definitely doesn't come easily to me. I plan to complete the intermediate lessons before I go ahead into the projects.

<h2 align="center"> Day 14: 04 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued practicing on FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Thoughts**: I found out that I am particularly terrible at algorithms. I am going to need to brush up on more exercises, I found myself getting stuck often and needing to refer to a lot of sources to solve the problems. This might take a while...

<h2 align="center"> Day 15: 05 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued practicing on FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Resources**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Intermediate-Algorithms)

**Thoughts**: I figured I should upload my progress into GitHub, so here it is. I think I did pretty well today, managed to get a few challenges done. Still a lot more to go before I finish the whole chapter though...

<h2 align="center"> Day 16: 06 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Studied about more algorithms. Also did some studying about Introduction to Python.

**Thoughts**: Still getting stumped by the algorithm challenges, I guess this is the part where I was told about not knowing what you don't know. I was always taught to use the functions and methods in a simple case scenario, I had no idea how to use them compounded together until I see some solutions. Hopefully I can catch the patterns and know how to use them again the next time.
