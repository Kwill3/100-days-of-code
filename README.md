# 100 Days of Code, progress log.

<h2 align="center"> Intro </h2>
Hello World! William Lee here and this is my log for the 100 Days of Code challenge. I've been learning coding on my own (online) for the most of the past year but I haven't been seriously making projects until recently. Since May 2018, I've been going through courses on codecademy and freecodecamp so I've had some knowledge of HTML, CSS and Javascript which should be sufficient for me to start doing some simple projects. In hindsight, the most useful thing I have learnt so far is to know how to search for the answers online and where to look for them. A lot of resources are actually easily found online but otherwise it would be helpful to have a friend or find help from the community. By the end of this challenge I hope to be able to at least be proficient in all the basics of front-end scripts and know how and where to learn the advanced concepts.

**Today's Progress**: Today is all about learning how to use GitHub through the terminal in Visual Studio Code, which is the IDE that I am using currently. I posted my 'test' repository and written down the steps from cloning the repository to adding and committing and putting update descriptions.

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp's GitHub tutorial by Tiffany Thompson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x0EYpi38Yp4)

**Thoughts**: GitHub definitely comes off as being intimidatingly intricate and using terminal to commit to repositories, even much so. However I hope to be able to make heads or tails of the whole site and it's functions as I've heard it is really useful to know the capabilities of GitHub.

**Today's Progress**: Did a simple clock project that takes the time from your device. 

**Resources**: [Coder's Digital Clock Project](https://googlecreativelab.github.io/coder-projects/projects/digital_clock/index.html)
[My own clock (Repository in GitHub)](https://github.com/Kwill3/clock)

**Thoughts**: It is a very simple project, very suitable for absolute beginners and in my case very refreshing to go over all the HTML and CSS scripts that I have learned a while back. It did taught me something new thought, which was how to use jQuery. It is my first time using jQuery and I hope to learn more about it.

<h2 align="center">  Day 2: 20 February 2019 </h2>

**Intro**: Started another clock project (I have no obsessions with clocks, I promise) which I have been wanting to do for a long time but never gotten around to doing it. I first saw this clock from Destin of SmarterEveryDay, back then I haven't even started learning coding and I was gonna build the physical clock but never gotten around to it. Now I get to build the virtual one! It is called a TIX clock and it is one geeky little clock. 

**Today's Progress**: I started by searching online to see if anyone has come up with one and found Xavier Decuyper's JS TIX clock, then I read through his blog post and tried to the best of my abilities to write my own code. I admit I had to resort to reading his source code to figure out how to structure my own JS code. I wasn't able to get mine to run.

**Resources**: [Xavier Decuyper's TIX](https://www.savjee.be/2014/02/TixClock-clone-in-Javascript/)
[SmarterEveryDay](https://youtu.be/VvVigAr4hZc?t=660)

**Thoughts**: I still have a ways to go to be proficient in Javascript, I would like to be able to write my own code for the entirety of a project without having to refer to someone else's code but sometimes I just don't know what functions do I need to use. I might need to do some reading on people's codes and see if I can't learn something.

<h2 align="center">  Day 3: 21 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued with my TIX clock, still did not manage to get it running correctly. I discovered a fault in my Visual Studio Code environment, which I must have set up incorrectly. When trying to 'node <js filename here>' in my terminal, my javascript file keeps getting 'document' and 'windows' not defined error prompts. I thought it was that I wasn't using the 'onload' or 'document.ready' or putting 'defer' to my JS script but after scouring the internet for hours and even asking for help from a friend, I still did not find out what was wrong.

**Thoughts**: By the end of the day before retiring to bed, my plans for tomorrow is to find out the root cause, which I figure probably might have something to do with the 'node' not working correctly in my IDE to access the DOM. I have squinted at every line of my code and still could not find what is wrong, it doesn't help that I couldn't use the debug feature on VS either (which might be also because of the same error).

<h2 align="center"> Day 4: 22 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the TIX clock project, figured the reason for 'node' running on my JS file to have undefined properties for 'document' is because it is just running the external JS file which is not linked to the HTML file therefore would not be defined. I also learned a bit more about source control in VS Code.

[Visual Code Studio tutorial by Traversy Media](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fnPhJHN0jTE)

**Thoughts**: Still struggling with using the full functionality of VS Code but overall improving my working knowledge of it. It is very helpful and saves me a lot of keystrokes though, just need to figure out how to debug my future external JS files or find another way to build the projects.

**Today's Progress**: Completed one of FreeCodeCamp's Responsive Web Design Project, which is the Survey Form Project.

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design - Survey Form](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form/)
[My Survey Form - CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/JZXaqb)
[GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Survey)

**Thoughts**: This was a fairly interesting project which I built with HTML and CSS, didn't find it to be too difficult but still had to look up online to jog my memory especially on the 'forms' part. OVerall, I now feel more confident working with HTML.

<h2 align="center"> Day 6: 24 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Got started on the next Responsive Web Design project by FreeCodeCamp which is to design a Product Landing Page. This is a much more challenging project for me because I never got to work with headers and video links prior to this, which meant I had to watch a tutorial before I could start writing my code. Also, I was recommended to use Bootstrap for this and the following projects. Thus my side quest to learn Bootstrap begins...

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design - Product Landing Page](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-product-landing-page/)

**Thoughts**: Still learning the ropes on Bootstrap. Got into a bit of a jam, I actually had some problems trying to add the bootstrap scripts into my html but I am still determined to push on.

<h2 align="center"> Day 7: 25 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the Product Landing page, managed to get the navigation bar to work. Watched a lot of tutorial videos and read Bootstrap documentation to better understand how to use Bootstrap to design my project.

**Resources**: [Bootstrap Navbar Resources](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/components/#navbar)

**Thoughts**: Managed to learn a lot about Bootstrap today, I think I am starting to get confident with using it. The challenge is to use Bootstrap and still fulfill all the requirements set to the project by FCC, not just create a nice looking landing page. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 8: 26 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: I just found out I have been updating my files wrongly in GitHub, I have been pushing commits into the master branch all the while. The best practice is to make a new branch, commit and push, then make a pull request to add it into the master branch. This is best practice to make the master branch 'clean'. Well I'm glad I found that out early. Besides that, I managed to complete almost 80% of the Landing Page project.

**Resources**: [GitHub commandline resources](https://dont-be-afraid-to-commit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/git/commandlinegit.html)

**Thoughts**: Everything went smoothly today. Bootstrap is actually a very handy tool in helping move things around according to the screen size, I'm glad there are tools out there like this to help make designing a device compatible website easier. Its funny to think that 24 hours ago, this seemed like a daunting task but now feel so intuitive.

<h2 align="center"> Day 9: 27 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed my Product Landing Page project. Next project is the Technical Documentation Page, which looks quite simple. I should be able to complete this without much difficulty.

**Resources**: [Product Landing Page CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/eXOgJQ)
[FreeCodeCamp - Technical Documentation Page Project](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-technical-documentation-page/)

**Thoughts**: I'm glad to have completed the project, after several days of working on it. Several images won't be able to load inside CodePen because I used an external image link which I am not able to upload into CodePen because I do not have a Pro account yet. Nevertheless you can get the full files and source code from my GitHub, if you are curious (it's nothing special though).

<h2 align="center"> Day 10: 28 February 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Almost all the way through with the Technical Documentation Page, just need to fix the side navigation bar which is proving to be difficult so far.

**Thoughts**: Working with Bootstrap certainly makes things a lot easier but I wonder if I need to train myself to know the intricate details of CSS so that it will help me immensely when I try to design in detail.

<h2 align="center"> Day 11: 01 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed the Technical Documentation Page by changing side navigation styling from Bootstrap to just pure CSS. Bootstrap wasn't working correctly to attach the navigation bar to the left of the page. Getting started on the last project in the Responsive Web Design series of FCC.

**Resources**: [Technical Doc in CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/zbrpqa)
[Personal Portfolio Webpage by FCC](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage)

**Thoughts**: I'm excited to finally come close to obtaining my first certification by FCC. I want to move on to hone my Javascript Algorithm and Data Structures skills next so I will probably be doing a lot of the for the whole of next week.

<h2 align="center"> Day 12: 02 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed the final Responsive Web Project by FCC!

**Resources**: [Personal Portfolio CodePen](https://codepen.io/Kwill3/pen/rReOMe)
[Personal Portfolio GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Personal-Portfolio)

**Thoughts**: I've been thinking of getting an image web hosting service, as I have only been using external attachments for images so far. For websites like CodePen, I am not able to link to my images to my projects and thus the page looks quite barren. Besides that, I am very proud to have completed the Responsive Web Design Projects by FCC and gotten my first certification. I will be aiming for the other achievements moving forward.

<h2 align="center"> Day 13: 03 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started on FreeCodeCamp's Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Resources**: [FCC Intermediate Algorithm Scripting](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/intermediate-algorithm-scripting)

**Thoughts**: I've always had trouble with Javascript algorithms, it definitely doesn't come easily to me. I plan to complete the intermediate lessons before I go ahead into the projects.

<h2 align="center"> Day 14: 04 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued practicing on FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Thoughts**: I found out that I am particularly terrible at algorithms. I am going to need to brush up on more exercises, I found myself getting stuck often and needing to refer to a lot of sources to solve the problems. This might take a while...

<h2 align="center"> Day 15: 05 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued practicing on FreeCodeCamp's Intermediate Javascript algorithm scripting.

**Resources**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Intermediate-Algorithms)

**Thoughts**: I figured I should upload my progress into GitHub, so here it is. I think I did pretty well today, managed to get a few challenges done. Still a lot more to go before I finish the whole chapter though...

<h2 align="center"> Day 16: 06 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Studied about more algorithms. Also did some studying about Introduction to Python.

**Thoughts**: Still getting stumped by the algorithm challenges, I guess this is the part where I was told about not knowing what you don't know. I was always taught to use the functions and methods in a simple case scenario, I had no idea how to use them compounded together until I see some solutions. Hopefully I can catch the patterns and know how to use them again the next time.

<h2 align="center"> Day 17: 07 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Between work and a company event I had today, I didn't have time to code on my computer but I discovered this amazing app that lets me code on my phone! So although I got home late, I managed to get my hour of code in. 

**Resources** : [SoloLearn](https://www.sololearn.com/)

**Thoughts**: This app is amazing! They have courses for programming languages like your usual run of the mill bootcamp but what I liked was that there was a challenge mode that lets you face off with other users in a 5 question quiz and puts XP points at stake. They also have badges to unlock which really motivates me to keep at it, I spent so much time on this app whenever I have some down time or when I'm on the move. I'm excited to go through the algorithm and data structures section. IT IS BRILLIANT. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 18: 08 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed 2 more intermediate algorithms challenges.

**Resources**: [GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Intermediate-Algorithms)

**Thoughts**: Learning code on SoloLearn really helps me recap all the things I have learned on Javascript way back when. I'm feeling more confident now when I am solving the algorithms, using new knowledge helps me to remember it better.

<h2 align="center"> Day 19: 09 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed one intermediate algorithms challenge and did a refresher course on ES6 JS using SoloLearn. 

**Thoughts**: I find returning to courses to refresh my memory helps to cement the functions that I haven't used as much. It is coming in very handy on my algo challenges, I find myself using functions that I haven't been using as much before.

<h2 align="center"> Day 20: 10 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed two intermediate algorithms challenge and started a course on jQuery in SoloLearn.

**Thoughts**: I'm proud of my progress this weekend because I had a lot of activities but I still managed to squeeze in time for 100 days of code. Being able to code on the move really helps a lot with this, as I used to only code while at home. Meanwhile I am making steady progress on the algorithms!

<h2 align="center"> Day 21: 11 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Got stumped on one of the algorithm challenges today, I am required to produce the LCM (lowest common multiple) of numbers within a range. Had to look up the solution which utilises the Euclidian Method to solve the problem.

**Thoughts**: Although I had to resort to peeking at the solution, I made sure I understood how to get to there so that I can solve it the next time.

<h2 align="center"> Day 22: 12 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed one intermediate algo challenge and studied about flattening deep arrays. 

**Thoughts**: Flattening deep arrays using Array.reduce() is very handy but I am still trying to wrap my head around the idea. It feels like trying to imagine a 4D structure, not so intuitive.

<h2 align="center"> Day 23: 13 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed three intermediate algos today, I am almost done with all the challenges, just one more to go and I'll be attempting the certification projects.

**Thoughts**: The challenges certainly seem to be getting easier as I get to the end, it's either I have gotten confident with my skills (more likely) or FreeCodeCamp arranges the challenges from difficult to easy (less likely). In any case, I am excited to be moving forward and to be getting my certification soon!

<h2 align="center"> Day 24: 14 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Finally completed the final intermediate algo challenge and also one of the FCC Algorithm and Data Structure Project!!!

**Resources**: [Intermediate Algorithms @ GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Intermediate-Algorithms)
[Data Structure and Algorithm Projects @ GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/FCC-Data-Structure-Algo-Projects)
[FCC Data Structure and Algorithm Projects](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures-projects)

**Thoughts**: It may not seem like much but this is a BIG DEAL for me! I've actually started JS on FCC for a while now and had completed some of the projects previously except for the last one which is the Cash Register project. I couldn't brain how to solve it myself until today, all the practices on intermediate algos definitely paid off. This actually means that I have gotten my Javascript Certification at last! Next milestone would be to continue on the Front End Libraries Certification by FCC, I previously stopped on React so I will be picking up where I left off.

<h2 align="center"> Day 25: 15 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Got started on the React module on FreeCodeCamp and Codecademy. 

**Resources**: [FreeCodeCamp React Challenges](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/react)
[Codecademy React Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/react-101)

**Thoughts**: React is a very interesting library, I can see how useful it could be to learn. Will be finishing the course before I move on to the projects.

<h2 align="center"> Day 26: 16 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Still progressing on the React module, no further updates so far.

<h2 align="center"> Day 27: 17 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learned about states and props in the React Module today.

**Thoughts**: React seems to be a really useful library, its great how states can update the DOM in 'real time' by using set.State(). I can see why React is one of the popular libraries used in recent times. I hope to be able to build some really interesting projects using React soon. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 28: 18 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learning about React Lifecycle Methods

**Thoughts**: Still a bit fuzzy about lifecycle methods, there are so many of them that I might require some usage before I can familiarise myself with them all.

<h2 align="center"> Day 29: 19 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Learnt about inline stles, ternary expression, and conditionals in React render method. 

**Thoughts**: I am just a few more lessons away from completing the FCC React Module, next up is the Redux module and the React Redux Module. Don't know if I will go through them or go straight to starting a React project to get some experience with working with React. Will look up how to proceed from here.

<h2 align="center"> Day 30: 20 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: I've completed the React lessons in Codecademy and FCC. I also went through Codecademy's article to setup React on my computer.

**Resources**: [React Setup on Codecademy part I (npm)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-i)
[React Setup on Codecademy part II (Babel)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-ii)
[React Setup on Codecademy part III (Webpack)](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-iii)
[React Setup part IV](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-iv)
[React Setup part V](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/react-setup-v)

**Thoughts**: Training wheels are off! Codecademy makes really good articles that guides you step by step to create your React Project, I'm glad to have access to such useful resources. I am sure I will be coming back to the articles many times in the future to create my modules. Next up I will be trying to start some React Projects from scratch and see what interesting stuff I can make!

<h2 align="center"> Day 31: 21 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Found out that I could start a React App using Facebook's node module, which is far simpler than what I have gone through yesterday. Basically what I did was went through the process manually but I think it is suffice to use the node module to generate a boilerplate version for my purposes for now. I also went through Reactjs.org's tutorial to build a simple tic-tac-toe game just to get a feel for making my first project.

**Resources**: [Codecademy - How to Create a React App](https://www.codecademy.com/articles/how-to-create-a-react-app)

**Thoughts**: Just when I thought the training wheels can be removed, turns out I still need them. That's coding for you. While I am learning all these stuff, I am starting to have an inkling of what I want to build for my first project. It will be a board game that I've played a lot with my brother as a child, I won't reveal it yet because its better if you see the final product for yourself. I wonder if I can manage to build it. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 32: 22 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Successfully built the tic-tac-toe project according to the steps given.

**Resources**: [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

**Thoughts**: It was fairly easy to follow the step by step guide to build the tic-tac-toe app, but I wonder if I will be able to build an app on my own from scratch. I've been scribbling out on random papers about how my next project will look like. I can't wait to get started!

<h2 align="center"> Day 33: 23 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: I've started to build my first app in React but still haven't figured out how to get it uploaded to GitHub. Probably going to try using GitHub Pages.

**Resources**: [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

**Thoughts**: I've quickly ran into obstacles as soon as I started on the project, I might have planned a more complicated project than I could handle. I might have to create a more simplified version of it before I can find ways to ramp it up to the version I envisioned it to be.

<h2 align="center"> Day 34: 24 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Today I tried to deploy a test react app to GitHub Pages. Also continued to work on the React App.

**Thoughts**: Deploying a React App is more complicated than I thought, I kinda figured it would be like pushing a new commit into GitHub and merging it with the master branch. However its a lot to do with editing the package.json file, dependencies and the scripts. Could not get it to work correctly yet.

<h2 align="center"> Day 35: 25 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: The React App continues to stump me, but I am making progress. Still couldn't get the deployment to work!

<h2 align="center"> Day 36: 26 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Finally managed to deploy my test app, which was the tutorial build from [reactjs.org](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)! 

**Resources**: [Deploying a ReactApp to GitHub Pages](https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages/tree/master)
[My first test upload](https://kwill3.github.io/TicTacToe/)

**Thoughts**: This tutorial in the resources is the best tutorial I have come across by far, because it goes through the step by step process you need to take and also explains what the commands are doing. I've read through a lot of discussions and also watched YouTube clips where they just blazed through the steps and left me more confused. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 37: 27 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started learning Redux on FCC.

**Resources**: [FCC Redux](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/redux)

**Thoughts**: After getting so stuck trying to even complete my first React Project, I've decided to get through with the FCC Front End Libraries Certification first before I pick up where I left off. I don't believe I have the required experience to complete the project that I want to create. Hopefully I can get back to it soon.

<h2 align="center"> Day 38: 29 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started building a React calculator app by following a youtube video.

**Resources**: [Calculator App Youtube Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KzYUuTiHdiY)
[React setState](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#setstate)

**Thoughts**: I've followed a tutorial to build a calculator for the most part, but I implemented my own features to it that is more advanced than the one shown in the video. For example percentage calculation functionality (still needs to be tidied up) and also having a backspace function (which I used a neat little icon to symbolise). I also have a nice multiline equation display which I am very proud of. I was stuck at the evaluation part for a long time because I needed to manipulate the state multiple times in a function, had to do a lot of research on the internet and came up with the solution of using the callback function in setState to follow up immediately after the state is changed. This is because React batches state changes and this causes the chronology to be a little complicated. There was also a preferred option to use component lifecycles but that was a little too complicated for me to implement.

<h2 align="center"> Day 39: 30 March 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued performing bug fixes and improving the calculator app. 

**Resources**: [React Calculator on GitHub](https://github.com/Kwill3/calculator)

**Thoughts**: I've uploaded the calculator app on GitHub and continued to improve on the buggy areas of the app. Fixed the issue of equations being evaluated but consequent calculations causing the new equations to be concatenated to the previous solutions. Will however, need to show the percentage symbol whenever using the percentage calculations. Fixed backspace button throwing error after a calculation, fixed operators not working correctly when switching operators halfway through a calculation, added functionality to perform multiple calculations using the operators without needing to use the "=" button, added reset functionality after completing a calculation, fixed percentage calculations which was incorrect. Although there are still work to be done, I'm very proud of the product I've come up with, please check it out on the link in resources!

<h2 align="center"> Day 40: 03 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: After a few days of absence, I'm finally back to coding with a new React app. This time I will be trying to make an app that fetches data from an API.

**Thoughts**: To train my skills with React, I need to make more projects which varies in their applications. I still find myself struggling to design the apps sometimes, hopefully as I make more projects I can train myself to get a better flow.

<h2 align="center"> Day 41: 05 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Having issues trying to fetch the API data into my app, still figuring out the fetch function. I'm using the Giphy API for this app.

**Resources**: [GIPHY API documentation](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/#path--gifs-search)

**Thoughts**: I am getting better at making apps with React, a lot of the knowledge is sticking into my brain better this time around. I can see that eventually all this is going to be second nature to me.

<h2 align="center"> Day 42: 06 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Managed to get the Giphy API to work and fetched some GIFs into my app. I have almost completed the app if not for a few more kinks that I can't seem to iron out.

**Thoughts**: Going through many React API tutorials really helped improve my understanding on fetching API data, eventually I will need to work on the posting part of it. Right now I have an issue with clearing the GIFs after every button click since I used 'createElement' and 'appendChild' to display my array of gif links. Somehow 'document.getElementByXXX' seems to be failing in my react components, unless it is to fetch 'root' or 'body'. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 43: 09 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Completed Giphy API app.

**Resources**: [Gifme App at Github Pages](http://Kwill3.github.io/gifme)

**Thoughts**: This project turned out way more difficult than I had anticipated. The pitfall that hindered me the most is trying to manipulate the src attribute of the images. For some reason I couldn't think of how to get it to work. Had to look that up after a few days of futile attempts. But at least I got it done, now I have another app in the pocket.

<h2 align="center"> Day 44: 10 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Did a little tweaking on the Giphy API app, search function improved to allow for multi word search. Fixed bugs - GitHub Pages doesn't allow API data from http sites. The app is running as it should now.

**Resources**: [Gifme App at Github Pages](http://Kwill3.github.io/gifme)
[Better Coding Academy on React Code Review](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLnTRniWXnjf-q34UdkkEFbhblMaIhZ0LF)

**Thoughts**: I feel like I did a good job on the app, although it looks terrible when I opened it on my mobile, probably need to fix that sometime in the future. I also came across a React code refactoring video on YouTube, where the person reviews the code written by someone else and I learnt a lot about writing neat code. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 45: 11 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Did another round of tweaking on the Giphy API app to make it look better on smaller devices.

**Resources**: [srcSet documentation](https://snowball.digital/blog/responsive-images-in-react-with-srcset)

**Thoughts**: I used 'srcSet' to pick sizes for my gifs used, and changed some other styling sizes. I think I am finally done with this project, on to the next one! 

<h2 align="center"> Day 46: 12 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Starting a new project that will be using API and React Router.

**Resources**: [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/web/guides/quick-start)

**Thoughts**: Still a little confused about the linking part of React Router. I am trying to link different components in different files but having no success so far. But I am excited to be doing this project using React Router, it is going to be great.

<h2 align="center"> Day 47: 13 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Making good progress on the latest project, I actually learnt a lot today on React Routers.

**Resources**: [Passing State from React Router to Components](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50616080/how-to-pass-state-in-react-router-to-components)

**Thoughts**: I managed to resolve the issue with passing states into React Routed Components. Frankly I am having a lot of fun on this project, working with NASA API is very interesting. It is going to be a good one, I know it. There is just so much lesser frustration and more sense of accomplishment with every obstacle I manage to overcome. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 48: 14 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Ongoing progress on the NASA API app, managed to overcome several hurdles today.

**Thoughts**: Today I was facing an issue which stumped me for a long time, an undefined prop which I am definitely sure wasn't the case because I had used that same method previously. Turns out it was because I was using it in a stateless/functional component and I did not pass in the prop as an argument. I was using stateful components all the while which is why I never had this problem previously. Such a silly little mistake which ended up taking so much time, but I am glad I learnt from it.

<h2 align="center"> Day 49: 15 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Almost completely done with the functionality of the NASA API app, just crossing the Ts and dotting the Is. Doing some bug checking and then will be proceeding to CSS styling for the app. 

**Thoughts**: My approach to this project is different from the rest I had done; in the sense that I decided to build the barebones functionality of the app before I went ahead to design the aesthetics of it. I feel by doing it this way I can quickly get the ideas down into the app and materialise it better. CSS is always my weaker point so if I leave it for last I can take my time and not stress out because at least I already know that the app works.

<h2 align="center"> Day 50: 16 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: The final steps prove to be the most difficult. Still stuck on trying to finish the functionality. 

**Thoughts**: React doesn't allow for objects to be a child element, only primitive values. Thus I will need to find a solution to pass down the entire data returned by NASA API which is in the form of a deeply nested object. Although not impossible, I might need a bit more time to process the whole thing. At least I am not stuck, just moving veeeery slowly...

<h2 align="center"> Day 51: 17 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued on the NASA API app. Managed to solve a big hurdle again today.

**Resources**: [componentDidUpdate documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#componentdidupdate)

**Thoughts**: I moved my api call into a subcomponent because it wasn't used in the parent component and I have never done that before. As such, I was struggling to fetch the API call because I didn't use my lifecycles correctly. At first I was calling a function in the render method which will then fetch the API and set the new state from the API data but an error appeared because changing states in the render method will cause an infinite loop. Then I used componentWillMount but since I need to fetch the API every time a form submitted, that obviously didn't work. So lastly, I changed it to componentDidUpdate. It was my first time using it and I ended up making an infinite did-update loop which blew my API call limit on the demo key I was using. After which I found out about comparing props in the componentDidUpdate method if states will be updated within the method. I wished I had read it earlier but then again, making this mistake is a lesson learned and I bet I will remember it the next time around. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 52: 18 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Still trying to finish up the functionality portion of the app. I have come to a realisation that few days ago what I have been seeing was just the tip of the iceberg. Committing changes to the app is like a big chain reaction where you will discover new bugs and set out to solve them. How naive I was to think that it was so simple and straightforward...

**Thoughts**: Today I learnt how to lift a prop up from a subcomponent to component and to the parent where it was set to the state; this was after a lot of trial and error and at one point I was trying to lift states up to parent components (which should not be done by the way...). Anyway I managed to figure out a way to pass the prop and replicate the results to the other elements that required to be done as such. However I had another problem of retrieving my form values from a parent component because the form consists of inputs nested in components and subcomponents. I ended up moving all the states up and changed my submit button so that I am not using componentDidUpdate anymore. I am glad I managed to overcome all the aforementioned issues, now back to fixing the api call and rendering all api data correctly.

<h2 align="center"> Day 53: 19 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Resolved previous issue I had with the API data. Did some cleaning on the code to improve readability.

**Thoughts**: Managed to solve the issue of not being able to pass down the data returned from API calls because React child components are not allowed to be objects or deeply nested arrays. I compiled each set of data I needed from the API call and pushed them into sets of arrays, which I then 'zipped' together in a function and mapped them into each individual image element. The latest problem I have now is to implement pagination to the data received from NASA API. Sometimes the search returns too big a database and pages will need to be implemented to prevent large download sizes happening at one go.

**Note**: I will be travelling to Germany for a week from tomorrow onwards therefore my 100 days of code quest will have to be put on hold temporarily; since I have no way to bring my laptop along with me. I may still be able to code a little here and there on my phone using SoloLearn but not big projects probably.

<h2 align="center"> Day 54: 27 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Today's focus was to implement pagination to the image search. Additionally, fixed a bug not fetching all the camera images from the rover. I need to set unique keys for the images as the next steps.

**Resources**: [Pagination npm published](http://jasonwatmore.com/post/2018/04/10/npm-jw-react-pagination-component)

**Thoughts**: I am back from my trip! Can't believe I am saying this but I am glad to be able to continue on my app. Started fresh on implementing pagination to my app, I found this npm published pagination component but still haven't gotten it to work. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 55: 28 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Continued working on the pagination, managed to get it to work. Also utilised the ID from the API to be the keys for respective image divs.

**Resources**: [Pagination](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40232847/how-to-implement-pagination-in-reactjs)

**Thoughts**: I managed to get my pagination to work using some code from stack overflow. The only thing I dislike about my code is that it needs to be cleaned, seems like that one component is doing too many things. With that, I have completed the functionality part of the app. Everything seems to be working as it should, will be testing for bugs once I complete the aesthetics part of the app. 

<h2 align="center"> Day 56: 29 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Started designing the CSS part of the app. Found some more bugs on the fetching API part, so spent some time fixing those too.

**Thoughts**: Although I am a lot better in CSS now, I still feel it looks a little basic. No matter, I am still proud of what I have created using React. Should be able to finish up soon if I dont discover more bugs.

<h2 align="center"> Day 57: 30 April 2019 </h2>

**Today's Progress**: Changed the favicon of the site, styled navigation headers and the footer, changed fonts and sizes. Image gallery still needs work though.

**Resources**: [How to change your app favicons](https://serverless-stack.com/chapters/add-app-favicons.html)

**Thoughts**: Progress is running smoothly, should be able to deploy the site soon. I already have plans to add a new manifest table functionality so users can fetch results based on that.
